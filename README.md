# Medical Chatbot with RAG Implementation of LLaMA-2

This repository implements a Medical Chatbot powered by the LLaMA-2 model, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware, and evidence-backed medical information. The chatbot is designed to assist users in obtaining answers to medical questions while referencing up-to-date medical literature and trusted sources.

## Key Features

- **LLaMA-2 Model Integration**: Built on the LLaMA-2 language model, known for its state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks, especially in understanding complex queries.
- **RAG Architecture**: Combines generative models with a retrieval system to fetch relevant documents from a medical knowledge base, improving the quality and relevance of responses.
- **Medical Knowledge Base**: Includes a curated dataset of medical literature, clinical guidelines, and trusted resources for accurate information retrieval.
- **Real-Time Answers**: Provides users with real-time responses that are informed by the latest medical findings and expert knowledge.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: The chatbot supports complex medical queries, offering detailed explanations, diagnoses, symptoms, treatment options, and general healthcare advice.

## Installation

### Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/praveenbharti1/medical_chatbot.git
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Set up the medical knowledge base:
#### Download and configure your medical corpus or use publicly available datasets (e.g., PubMed, clinical notes).

### Update configuration files with the path to your knowledge base.

## Run the chatbot server:
```bash
python app.py
```
Start interacting with the chatbot at http://localhost:5000.

## Usage
Input medical queries via a web interface or API.

The model will retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base and generate contextually relevant, natural-sounding responses.

### Example Queries
"What are the symptoms of Type 2 diabetes?"

"What are the latest treatments for breast cancer?"

"Can you explain the side effects of aspirin?"

### Technologies Used
**LLaMA-2:** A large language model for generating and understanding natural language text.

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Enhances the modelâ€™s generative capabilities by retrieving relevant documents before generating responses.

**Hugging Face Transformers:** For accessing and fine-tuning the LLaMA-2 model.

**FastAPI/Flask:** Lightweight backend framework for deploying the chatbot as an API.

**PyTorch:** Framework for implementing and fine-tuning LLaMA-2.
